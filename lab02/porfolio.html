    <p>Below are a few projects that I'm a part of.</p>
    <h2>Cat Rancher</h2>

    <p>In a Game Development course myself and 4 team members worked on our first game. We decided to
        create a game with a cat as the main character. At the time, we didn't really know any popular cat games.
        Ironically this was around the same time that Stray was released for consoles and it turned out to be a big hit.
        The game is a 3-D platformer game with multiple levels that have different focuses. One level is a
        collect-a-thon,
        another allows you to herd cats and another has the player capturing mice. The game is still in development.
        below
        are some screenshots from a very early part of our development process. Not updated screenshots are available at
        this time.

    <h2>CS 355 Program 1</h2>
    <p>In CS 355-Probability and Stastics in CS, myself and another student, worked on a python program that simulated a
        deck of cards numbered 1-52 being shuffled in different methods to create a permutation of the original deck.
        Here's
        a pdf that cover's each part of the code.

    <h2>A Princess' Castle</h2>
    <!-- 
                    <th> <img src="spider2.jpeg" alt="spider image 1" height="150"></th>

    <p>Here is a photo of a castle that I am in the process of building after my daughter "demanded" that I do. She
        wants me to take
        inspiration from her favorite Disney films and create her a castle with over 5 bedrooms that she gets to occupy
        all by herself.
        The only thing she required for this castle outside of the 5 bedrooms is that it is built upon 200 acres of land
        so she has plenty of
        room for all of her horses. Although she has two younger siblings, I have been informed that they will not have
        authorized access to
        the castle under any circumstances. I am only able to visit for the purpose of maintence and celebrations.
