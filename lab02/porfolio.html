        <h1>Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Here's a couple projects that I've worked on since studying Computer Science.</p>
        <h2>Cat Rancher</h2>
                <!--

                -->
                <p>In a Game Development course myself and 4 team members worked on our first game. We decided to
                    create a game with a cat as the main character. At the time, we didn't really know any popular cat games.
                    Ironically this was around the same time that Stray was released for consoles and it turned out to be a big hit.
                    The game is a 3-D platformer game with multiple levels that have different focuses. One level is a collect-a-thon,
                    another allows you to herd cats and another has the player capturing mice. The game is still in development. below
                    are some screenshots from a very early part of our development process. Not updated screenshots are available at
                    this time.

                </p>
            <table>
                <th> <img src="catrancher.png" alt="cat image 1" height="200"></th>
                <th> <img src="catrancher2.png" alt="cat image 2" height="200"></th>
            </table>
        <h2>CS 355 Program 1</h2>
                <p>In CS 355-Probability and Stastics in CS, myself and another student, worked on a python program that simulated a
                    deck of cards numbered 1-52 being shuffled in different methods to create a permutation of the original deck. Here's
                    a pdf that cover's each part of the code.

        <h3>Note: I've decided not to share too many code snippets that are from assignments and I don't quite have any personal projects that I'd like
             to share at this time. I hope that the two projects above will suffice for the purpose of this assignment.</h3>
