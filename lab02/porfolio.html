        <p>Here's a few of the projects that I've worked on since studying Computer Science.</p>
        <h2>Cat Rancher</h2>

                <p>In a Game Development course myself and 4 team members worked on our first game. We decided to
                    create a game with a cat as the main character. At the time, we didn't really know any popular cat games.
                    Ironically this was around the same time that Stray was released for consoles and it turned out to be a big hit.
                    The game is a 3-D platformer game with multiple levels that have different focuses. One level is a collect-a-thon,
                    another allows you to herd cats and another has the player capturing mice. The game is still in development. I don't
                    have any screenshots at this time, but here's a link to our GitHub repository.
