        <p>Hello, my name is Nahtanrac Eibo. I am a senior Computer Science student at
            The University of Alabama at Birmingham. I've studied various programming languages and completed
        several projects during my three years. Outside of Computer Science
        some of my interests are physical fitness, sports, music and reading. I am greatly appreciative of you
        for taking the time to view my website.
        </p>
